# secron
Secron is a crontab add-on for making the crontab/cronjobs.
The idea of secron project is to make crontab perform cronjobs to be run in smaller time intervals,i.e, in seconds
secron is designed not as an alternative to crontab but rather a program the adds support to it.
May be in later stages developments can put for making secron better.

crontab is only capable to run a job at a minimum time interval of 1 minute by its own.
But we can emulate it to run jobs wthin less than a minute.
This is what secron does

The code is fully written in bash and will be able run in any Linux/Unix-Like systems.
Secron is written specifically for using inside the crontab eventhough you can run from terminal directly.

All developers, Linux, Unix lovers, Opensource contributors are Welcome to this Project.

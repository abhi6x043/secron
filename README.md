# secron
Secron is a crontab add-on for making the crontab/cronjobs to work in the seconds time interval
The idea of secron is make crontab to allow cronjob to be run in smaller time intervals,i.e, in seconds

crontab is only capable to run a job at a minimum time interval of 1 minute by its own.
But we can emulate it to run jobs wthin less than a minute.
This is what secron does

The code is fully written in bash and will be able run in any Linux/Unix-Like systems.
Secron is written specifically for using inside the crontab eventhough you can run from terminal directly.
